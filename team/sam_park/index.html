            <p>Hi I’m Sam.</p>

<p>I’m a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering, advised by Prof. Jean Oh. My
research focus revolves around learning-based approaches and self-supervised
learning techniques for socially-compliant robot/vehicle navigation and domain
adaptation. Additionally, I am interested in computer vision and perception in
the fields of autonomous vehicles and robotics.</p>

<p>In my pastime, I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer, and baking.</p>
