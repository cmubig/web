        <div class="content">
            <p>Jean Oh is an Associate Research Professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University. Jean is passionate about creating persistent robots that can
co-exist and collaborate with humans in shared environments, continuously
learning to improve themselves over time through training, exploration,
and interactions. Toward this general goal, her current research is focused on
the topics at the intersection among vision, language, and planning in robotics.</p>

<p>Jean has been leading several robot intelligence tasks in government, defense,
and commercial projects in various problem domains including human-robot teaming,
self-driving cars, disaster response, eldercare, and arts. Jean heads an
interdisciplinary research group, Bot Intelligence Group (BIG), that includes
postdoctoral researchers, PhD, MS, and undergraduate students from the Robotics
Institute, Language Technologies Institute, Computer Science Department, Machine
Learning Department, School of Information Science, and Mechanical Engineering
Department.</p>

<p>Jeanâ€™s team has won two Best Paper Awards in Cognitive Robotics at
IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in 2015 and 2018
for the works on following natural language directions in unknown environments
and socially-compliant robot navigation in human crowds, in 2015 and 2018,
respectively. Jean received her Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies
at Carnegie Mellon University, M.S. in Computer Science at Columbia University,
and B.S. in Biotechnology at Yonsei University in South Korea.</p>
